dynjs.org
=========

The new website for dynjs.org. You need [Harp](http://harpjs.com) to build it. Once you've got that:

    $ harp server 
    
To compile the site to static files for deployment

    $ harp compile 

This will generate a dynjs.org/www directory which can be deployed with your favorite
synchronization method.
