noticed in NPMs sometimes stuff like require('./lib/express') is used. This leads to absolute paths containing the . folder name causing the generated module IDs sometimes not matching. This affects mostly the NPM stuff in NoDyn, but it could be an issue in FilesystemModuleProvider as well. Thus, I compute the canonical path here to fix both places.
